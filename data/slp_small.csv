I enjoy working within the early childhood setting with children with varied disabilities/needs.",It is frustrating when school districts place children in the wrong placement. I also wish to have the same pay/benefits as an SLP in a school district. ,I think compensation should be addressed in this survey. There is such a gap between pay based on the setting that SLP's work in. ,1,"We had to learn how to do teletherapy fast to help accommodate our students. When we came back to school, different rules were put into place to keep everyone safe, however the rules did not always make sense. Most importantly, wearing a mask while providing therapy to young language learners, children with hearing impairments, ASD students, and while providing articulation therapy was difficult. I felt like it was a disservice for our students. ASHA had a statement that there were no studies to support the long-term impact on speech and language development when young children interact with adults who are wearing facemasks, however as a clinician we were always taught the importance of children being able to watch our mouths to produce sounds, facial expressions, and to improve eye contact. 1 technique while providing Early Intervention is to place desired objects near our face to improve eye contact but as for the child to watch us model words. This clearly was not as much effective while wearing a mask."
